## Overview

**AI or Not** is an interactive and engaging game where players test their skills at distinguishing between AI-generated and real YouTube comments. Inspired by the growing influence of artificial intelligence in online spaces, this game challenges users to see if they can spot the difference between human and machine-generated content.<br/><br/>

Players are presented with a series of YouTube comments and must guess whether each comment is written by a real person or generated by an AI. The goal is to score as high as possible by making the correct guesses, while the snarky in-game robot host eggs them on, providing a playful and sometimes challenging commentary.<br/><br/>

This project was created to explore the boundaries of AI text generation and offer a fun, interactive way to raise awareness about AI's capabilities in mimicking human language.<br/><br/>
